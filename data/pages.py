                Chase was raised in Bowling Green, KY and came to Oak Park in 2012. He is married to
                Sarah and has four children: Grace, Hannah, Andrew, and Lillian. Chase came to trust
                the Lord Jesus during his first semester of college and was discipled in a local
                church for the next four years. He has seminary degrees from both The Master's
                Seminary and The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Chase desires to see
                Christians built up by the truths of God's Word, so that they may be equipped
                to encourage others and make Christ known.

                Angela since 2013. They had their first son, Ezra, in September of 2015. Joshua
                committed to following Christ at a young age and served faithfully through his early
                college years at U of L. He lived in rebellion to God for a few years until several
                circumstances returned him to God's purposes. Eventually the Lord led him to exit
                the business world so he could serve the church full-time in spring 2015. Joshua now
                uses his organizational skills to support the church. He possesses a heart for
                reaching the children and families around Oak Park.

                Mike came to Oak Park in 2002 after moving to the area from Iowa with his wife
                Christine. They have two daughters, two sons-in-law, two grandsons, and two
                granddaughters. Mike grew up in a Christian family where his parents were both
                actively involved in the local church. When he was eight years old, he realized that
                a person does not become a Christian by association, and trusted Jesus Christ as
                Lord and Savior during an evangelistic crusade at his church in Detroit, Michigan.
                He is excited to be involved in working with adults, teaching God's Word in
                Discipleship Classes, and leading the Amazing Grays senior adult ministry. Mike is
                retired from a position in the transportation industry.
